# Bayesian Analysis

This code analyzes HRV data using bayesian regressions. First I wrangle the data and check for assumptions, and then I build three bayesian models: one using a simple function from the BRMS package, another using the rich functionalities from RSTANARM, and a final one with full manual control over the model using RSTAN alongside a .stan file.
